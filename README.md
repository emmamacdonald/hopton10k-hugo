# Hopton 10k hugo web project

([Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) project for the Hopton 10k running race website which uses a butchered version of the Universal web template.

To build and deploy the project run `./deploy`. The dist files are published to `/public` which is a git module hosted at ([hopton10k.github.io]https://github.com/m0nkmaster/hopton10k.github.io)

Simple as that.

The site is hosted at http://hopton10k.run
